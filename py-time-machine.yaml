# Source location(s). Note, that it might be from local file system, or
# remote. Local/remote locations cannot be mixed. Also it's impossible
# to do rsync from remote to remote locations. To use remote location, use:
# - [user@]host:/remote/path
# Same applies for "dest" section.
source:
  # it can be either single entry, like:
  # source: /home/infinet
  # or a list:
  - /home/infinet/
  - /etc/
  - /root/
  - /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
# As for destination, it required to be single entry
dest: /mnt/usbbackup/time-capsule/tungsten/

# This section can be omitted. You can define here patterns to be excluded
# from syncing.
exclude:
  # Match whole filename or directory name, because rsync is recursive, all
  # sub-dirs are also matched. Watch out for special characters - they need to
  # be enclosed in quotes.
